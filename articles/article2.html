        <div class="article-content">
            <p>It starts with the history that we have in the past. Around the 17th century we were under constant control of kings and exploiters, from Mughals to Britishers, almost 400 years of exploitation. We are used to being exploited by anyone who has power and control. It is like generations passed and everyone was okay with the exploitation. Anywhere in the world, if any revolution happens, a major chunk of the country’s population participates in that revolution, but when it comes to us Indians, the freedom fighters, the ones who revolted against the exploitation, are very few. We as Indians are very scared, we never fought, we never wanted to fight except a few. That is why we see very few people fighting against corrupt government officials, that’s why we see very few people questioning the recent children’s deaths due to the collapse of a school building, because the fear is in our genetics. Yes, it is.</p>
            <p>But to the contrary, we Indians are very brave when it comes to situations where no one is seeing and no one has control, when we have absolute freedom, when we have absolute power, when we have absolutely no accountability. This takes us to why Indians don’t deserve freedom. To explain this, in a recent situation at a top B-school in India, a placement committee formed by senior students ragged the juniors in the name of making them ready for corporate life. And this happened in the top B-school, where all the students have enough maturity and education. But why did it happen? It’s not about the people or the students who did it, it’s because we don’t deserve freedom, we don’t deserve positions of responsibility, because we make positions of responsibility into positions of power. We try to exploit everything as much as we can.</p>
            <p>The second reason is the fear. Everyone will have it by nature, but we Indians have the fear to the level we can’t imagine. Imagine a situation where you cracked a competitive exam and joined by chasing 3 lakh people and while being in the top 1000 people, you still can’t tell the senior placement member that he is crossing his line. We can’t, because we have an inbuilt fear — what if they target you, what if they interrupt in the placement process and you end up without any placement? This is the thought process we have. Why can’t we complain? No one even thinks of it.</p>
            <p>This is just an example. We have a lot more. When we start to list out the issues by politicians and government employees, the list goes to infinity. And we are habituated to blame the government for everything. Just before blaming the government, why can’t we ask ourselves — are we dropping the litter in the dustbin or on the road? Before questioning the government, can’t we ask ourselves one question — are we exploiting any situation where we have the power? In India, 90% of us just want to exploit things whenever we have a chance. The RTA will only issue a licence if you go through a broker by paying bribery. Even if you don’t know driving, you will easily get it. You only get the work done in government offices with bribery or by a mediator who works in a government office.</p>
            <p>Leaving all this aside, many people lost their lives in a stampede at RCB winning celebrations, many died at Delhi railway station due to the same, many died at Maha Kumbh. Who are the ones who died? Indians. Who are the ones who ran over them and killed them? Indians. We can’t even wait for one minute and can kill people. For us, the celebrity is more important than a life. And again, we don’t deserve freedom — that freedom for which people died in the name of it, leaving their family life and adulthood. They sacrificed their life for that freedom that as Indians we don’t deserve.</p>
            <p>It’s almost 78 years, near to a century since we got freedom, but we still don’t know and understand what is the definition of civic sense and what it means to be honest as a government official, what is the value of life of children who died by the school building collapse, or the newborn children who lost their lives due to a fire accident at a government hospital. In India at most, not more than 100 people die because of terror attacks, but by the inner terror it is nearly 5000 to 6000. In this we have — deaths due to drunk driving: 4,201, bridge collapse: 32, deaths due to stampede: 157. All these deaths are caused by Indians.</p>
            <p>We Indians are the ones creating the terror. And at the end, you give an Indian to drive a car, he doesn’t just use it for driving — he goes to the level where he ends up hitting someone by overspeeding or by drunk driving. You give an Indian a responsibility to take care of something — he doesn’t just take care, he will exploit the situation where he wants benefit out of it. And that’s why we don’t deserve freedom. We are moving towards 100 years of independence. I hope even at the 100th year, the Indians will deserve the freedom. And happy independence day</p>

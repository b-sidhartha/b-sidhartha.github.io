            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Before 1960, India’s population was growing at a very fast pace, but food production was limited. Even in normal times the country faced shortages of food grains, and in war-like situations the crisis worsened. Then, in the 1960s, a magic called the Green Revolution happened, introduced by M. S. Swaminathan. It brought new practices into traditional agriculture: high-yielding varieties, use of fertilizers and pesticides, chemical inputs, and modern irrigation methods. With the Green Revolution, India moved from scarcity to surplus. Recent estimates suggest that India now produces more rice and wheat than required. Agrochemicals started as a solution to India’s food crisis, but today their use looks more like an obsession than a necessity.</p>
                <p>Telangana is a clear example. The state ranks third in pesticide consumption, with an average of 900 g/ha, behind Punjab and Haryana, and its usage is growing at 2.9% CAGR compared to the national average of 1.9%. The reason lies in the state’s monocropping pattern. Farmers mostly grow cotton and paddy, making the crops highly vulnerable to pests and diseases, which in turn drives chemical demand. About 67% of chemicals used in Telangana fall under WHO Class 1, meaning extremely hazardous. Cotton, which covers just 5% of India’s cropped area, accounts for nearly 50% of pesticide consumption. Chilli, another high-value crop, attracts heavy pest attacks. Together, these two crops drive massive chemical use. Climate change adds another layer: rising global temperatures reduce pesticide effectiveness by making them evaporate faster, while also creating warmer conditions that favor pest growth. This means farmers are forced to spray more frequently.</p>
                <p>The logic behind agrochemicals is simple: they protect crops, increase yields, and therefore raise income. But this logic works better for large farmers, not small or medium ones. For small farmers, pesticides come with heavy price tags, raising input costs and shrinking profit margins. Over time, pests develop resistance, forcing even more frequent spraying, which further increases costs. Yes, chemicals do prevent crop losses—global estimates suggest farmers could lose up to 65% of crops without pesticides. They are effective against weeds, diseases, and insects, and can improve yields by 28–70%. For farmers whose entire income depends on crops, this feels like a necessity, not a luxury. But does this really mean better profits?</p>
                <p>Pesticides promise higher yields, but they also create hidden costs. Between 2008 and 2015, the per-hectare cost of cultivation rose by 52% for paddy, 92% for maize, and 150% for cotton, the most pesticide-intensive crop. Much of this rise is due to fertilizers and pesticides. The result is that farmers put in more effort, but end up with profitless productivity and reduced net returns.</p>
                <p>Beyond profit and loss, Telangana’s fields have become occupational hazard zones. Globally, 44% of farmers are poisoned by pesticides. After spraying, farmers report dizziness, headaches, blurred vision, and skin irritation. These short-term effects are so normalized that they are ignored. But long-term exposure is far more dangerous: neurological disorders, cancers, and irreversible cellular damage. A recent study on Telangana farmers found low levels of the enzyme Acetylcholinesterase—a classic marker of pesticide poisoning caused by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, the most commonly used chemicals. Safety kits could help, but here’s the reality: 90% of farmers don’t use them. Government agriculture officers rarely provide awareness, and private dealers who sell pesticides are not accountable. This is a clear case of system failure.</p>
                <p>It is shocking to know that only 1–2% of sprayed chemicals reach the intended target. The remaining 98–99% contaminate air, water, and soil. This leads to soil degradation, polluted water bodies, and pesticide residues in food. Alarmingly, pesticide levels in some Indian food products exceed permissible limits. Recently, the US Food Safety Department banned Indian masalas citing excessive chemical residues. European countries have gone further, completely banning several Indian food exports for the same reason.</p>
                <p>We started using chemicals because of food scarcity. Today, India has surplus food. The problem is no longer hunger, but rising diseases like diabetes and obesity. Eliminating chemicals overnight is not possible—we don’t want to repeat Sri Lanka’s mistake. Instead, the shift must be step by step. Farmers must stop chasing the obsession of a “perfect crop.” Crops will always have some pests and diseases. The key is to know when chemicals are truly necessary. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) can help. For example, conventional rice production costs around ₹5,961 per hectare, while natural farming costs only about ₹846. Profit margins clearly improve when farmers reduce chemical use.</p>
                <p>Enabavi, a small village in Warangal district, faced similar problems. But its 52 households made a collective decision to abandon chemicals completely. They adopted Non-Pesticidal Management (NPM), using methods like pheromone traps to catch insects, intercropping to improve soil fertility and break pest cycles, and homemade botanical extracts such as neem and chilli-garlic sprays. The results were remarkable: soil and human health improved, crops became more drought-resilient, and in 15 years not a single farmer suicide was reported. The farmers also formed a cooperative to sell organic produce directly to Hyderabad consumers, cutting out exploitative middlemen and securing better prices. Enabavi stands as a classic example of a sustainable future. It shows that collective willpower, farmer awareness, and community action can break free from the chemical trap.</p>
